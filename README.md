**Seed Monitoring System**

*High tech for deep roots*

Seed Sentinel is an open-source platform designed to democratize "Nature Intelligence" by translating the silent language of plants into actionable insights. Combining low-cost, distributed soil telemetry with an adaptive AI botanist, the system monitors real-time environmental conditions and compares them against species-specific needs—whether you are growing rare native prairie flowers or backyard vegetables. By replacing guesswork with data-driven guidance, Seed Sentinel lowers the barrier to ecological restoration, empowering anyone to successfully grow any seed and deepen their connection to the natural world without proprietary lock-in.
